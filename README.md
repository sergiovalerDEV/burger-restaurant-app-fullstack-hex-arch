# Burguer Puig: Full-Stack Hexagonal Architecture Project 🍔🏗️

## Overview

Welcome to the Burguer Puig project repository! This comprehensive full-stack application marks my second venture into building a complete web solution, emphasizing scalable architecture, industry best practices, and enhanced security measures.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Hexagonal Architecture Backend**: Meticulously designed Java backend adhering to hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture principles.
- **Rigorous Frontend Design**: JavaScript frontend implemented with a focus on structure, maintainability, and performance.
- **Burger King Inspired UI**: User interface closely modeled after the renowned fast-food chain, Burger King.
- **AWS-Ready Database**: PostgreSQL database prepared for seamless deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- **Scalability Focus**: Engineered to handle growth and increased load, suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Enhanced Security**: All passwords have been expired, mitigating potential vulnerabilities in this aspect.

## 🏛️ Architecture

### Backend (Java)
- Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) architecture
- RESTful API controllers
- Domain-driven design principles
- Separation of concerns for enhanced maintainability

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- Modular design for improved code organization
- State management for complex UI interactions
- Responsive layout for various device sizes
- Accessibility considerations

### Database
- PostgreSQL
- Designed for easy deployment on AWS
- Optimized schema for fast-food ordering system

### Security
- Password expiration mechanism implemented
- Regular security audits and updates

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is designed for cloud deployment, with specific considerations for AWS services:
- Backend: Elastic Beanstalk or ECS
- Frontend: S3 with CloudFront
- Database: RDS (PostgreSQL)

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project serves as a practical exploration of:
1. Full-stack development practices
2. Hexagonal architecture implementation
3. Scalable database design
4. Cloud-ready application architecture
5. Security best practices in web applications

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Backend: Java
- Frontend: Native CSS, JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Version Control: Git

## 🔜 Future Enhancements

- Implement microservices architecture
- Add real-time order tracking
- Integrate with third-party delivery services
- Enhance analytics and reporting features
- Implement multi-factor authentication

## 🔒 Security Note

As of the latest update, all passwords in the system have been expired. This proactive measure addresses any potential vulnerabilities related to password security. Users will be required to create new, strong passwords upon their next login attempt.

This project demonstrates my growing expertise in full-stack development and my commitment to building scalable, maintainable, and secure applications. As my second full-stack project, it showcases significant progress in understanding complex architectures and implementing complete solutions. The AWS-ready PostgreSQL database underscores the project's readiness for large-scale deployment, reflecting the comprehensive nature of this learning experience.

The recent security update, expiring all passwords, demonstrates an ongoing commitment to maintaining the highest standards of application security.

I welcome feedback, contributions, and discussions about the architectural choices, implementation details, and security measures implemented in this project.
